Stay updated about modifications on SoftLayer API, read our [page]({{ site.url }}/softlayer_updates) to know more information about these updates.

This week we just have one modification, check it out!

## Network_Subnet_IpAddress

Was added the method `getApplicationDeliveryController`, so if the specified IP Address is being used by a [Application Delivery Controller](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Network_Application_Delivery_Controller) you can get it without list all your ADC and search for your IP Address.

Some small changes were made on the datatype attributes, here is a summary

* SoftLayer_Billing_Payment_Card_ChangeRequest
	* Added `ticketId`
* SoftLayer_Container_Product_Order_Cart_Item
	* Removed `datacenterCountryIneligibility`
	* Removed `datacenterDescription`
	* Removed `ineligibleAccountCountries`
* SoftLayer_Product_Package
	* Removed `categoryCount`

See you next week!
