Stay updated about modifications on SoftLayer API, read our [page]({{ site.url }}/softlayer_updates) to know more information about these updates.

This week we have two modifications on SoftLayer API, and methods were added so not break is expected.

## Hardware

__Hardware__ and its descendants (Hardware_Router, Hardware_SecurityModule and Hardware_Server) has a new method, the __executeRemoteScript__, according to documentation this method is used to

> Download and run remote script from uri on the hardware.

this method signature is `executeRemoteScript(uri:string)` so you just need to pass a uri to this method.

## Network_Storage

Another modification is for __Network_Storage__ and its descendants (Network_Storage_Backup_Evault and Network_Storage_Iscsi) where the method __getObjectStorageConnectionInformation__ was added.

About the method signature, no parameters is needed and it will return an array with [SoftLayer_Container_Network_Service_Resource_ObjectStorage_ConnectionInformation](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Container_Network_Service_Resource_ObjectStorage_ConnectionInformation) objects

See you next week!
