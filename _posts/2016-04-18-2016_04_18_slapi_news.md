Stay updated about modifications on SoftLayer API, read our [page]({{ site.url }}/softlayer_updates) to know more information about these updates.

To start, `SoftLayer_Catalyst_Company`, `SoftLayer_Locale`, `SoftLayer_Software_AccountLicense` and `            SoftLayer_User_Customer_Prospect_ServiceProvider_EnrollRequest` were not working as services on the gem, but now the problem is solved :)

## SoftLayer_Network_Monitor_Version1_Query_Host

Method `get_subnet` was removed.

## SoftLayer_Notification_Occurence_Resouce_Network_Storage

New types added for storage notification

* `SoftLayer_Notification_Occurence_Resouce_Network_Storage_Lockbox`
* `SoftLayer_Notification_Occurence_Resouce_Network_Storage_Nas`
* `SoftLayer_Notification_Occurence_Resouce_Network_Storage_Iscsi_EqualLogic`
* `SoftLayer_Notification_Occurence_Resouce_Network_Storage_Lockbox`

These four types has attributes `hostname`, `private_ip` and `resource_type`, so probably the idea was provide types for more specific notifications.

This was a quiet week on SoftLayer API world.. and our gem is moving fast to v1.0.0 :D

See you next week!
