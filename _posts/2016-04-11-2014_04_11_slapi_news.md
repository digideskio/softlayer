Stay updated about modifications on SoftLayer API, read our [page]({{ site.url }}/softlayer_updates) to know more information about these updates.

This week we just have pratically one modification on the API

## SoftLayer_Network_Storage

Added the method `getManualSnapshots` where you can get the manually created snapshots associated with this network storage volume, a good observation is that this method does __not__ support pagination by result limit and offset.

as `SoftLayer_Network_Storage_Backup_Evault` and `SoftLayer_Network_Storage_Iscsi` inherits the network storage object, both received the method too.

on the relation properties, now we have `manualSnapshotsCount`, to get the total

## SoftLayer_Product_Package_Server

Added the properties `datacenters` for the these server package, so on this property we can access a comma-separated list of datacenters names this server is available in, check this example:

```ruby
servers = Softlayer::Product::Package::Server.get_all_objects
servers.size
# => 55
servers.first.datacenters
# => "ams01,ams03,che01,dal01,dal05,dal06,dal07,dal09,fra02,hkg02,hou02,lon02,mel01,mex01,mil01,mon01,par01,sjc01,sjc03,sao01,sea01,sng01,syd01,tok02,tor01,wdc01,wdc04"
```

if you would like to list all servers available on `sao01`

```ruby
sao01_servers = servers.select { |x| x.datacenters =~ /sao01/ }
sao01_servers.size
# => 34
```

What you think? Will `datacenters` be useful to you, solve any current problem?

See you next week!
