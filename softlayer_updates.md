If you are here, probably you have read some of our weekly SoftLayer News edition, and we just like to make sure you know some points about it:

* It's __not__ the official SoftLayer updates, check [http://softlayer.github.io](http://softlayer.github.io) for the official one
* As we keep our client as most updated as possible, we update on weekly basis, check the modifications and write it down here, just to make it easier to our users be aware what it changing.
* It's based on WSDL and XSD files, we do really expect they are ok, but we can't ensure the modification will work 100% as expected.

So, stay up to date to our SoftLayer API News and enjoy it!
