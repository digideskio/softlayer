An example templateObject that updates global load balancer account properties, updates the properties of a host, and adds a new host is shown below: \n\n\n* id: 2\n* loadBalanceTypeId: 2\n* notes: Notes updated\n* fallbackIp: 1.1.1.1\n* hosts:\n** id: 19\n** destinationIp: 2.2.2.2\n** weight: 25\n** healthCheck: http\n** destinationPort: 80\n** enabled: 1<br \/><br \/>\n** destinationIp: 3.3.3.3\n** weight: 25\n** healthCheck: http\n** destinationPort: 80\n** enabled: 1\n\n\n\n\nThe first section contains the properties of the global load balancer account that will be updated, while the second section contains the elements of the 'hosts' property of the global load balancer account.  The first host listed will have its properties updated because the 'id' property of the host is set, meaning the global load balancer host with an id of 19 will be updated. The second host listed will be created because it lacks the 'id' property. \n\nThere is a limit to the maximum number of hosts that you are allowed to add, and is defined by the allowedNumberOfHosts property on the global load balancer account.  The destination IP address of a host must be an IP address that belongs to your SoftLayer Account, or a local load balancer virtual IP address that belongs to your account.  The destination IP address and destination port are required and must be provided when creating a host.

Individual customer accounts can have more than one CDN account. \n\nEvery CDN account has the capability to configure and upload content to SoftLayer's CDN infrastructure. When a user requests content from the CDN they retrieve data from the node in closest physical proximity to them, assuring failover in the case of single node failure and the lowest network latency possible. \n\nCDN supports three distinct types of content, streaming Flash, streaming Windows Media and traditional HTTP. Each of these types of service are automatically set depending on the folder you upload your content to. Each of these types of content are accessed from different URLs. URL examples can be found on the [https:\/\/manage.softlayer.com customer portal]. \n\nCDN supports directory creation, [[SoftLayer_Network_ContentDelivery_Account::getBandwidthData|bandwidth reporting]], and an [[SoftLayer_Network_ContentDelivery_Account::createOriginPullRule|Origin Pull]] rule if you wish to manage your content directly on one of your servers. Files uploaded to CDN are accessed by users in directories relative to your account's root directory. For instance, if the file \"\/images\/header.jpg\" exists in your CDN space then it can be accessed at the URL \"<nowiki>http:\/\/<your CDN username>.http.cdn.softlayer.net\/00<your CDN username>\/images\/header.jpg<\/nowiki>\" \n\nCDN accounts support FTP transfers in addition to API-based uploads. To access a CDN account's FTP space on the SoftLayer private network, log into '''ftp.cdnlayer.service.softlayer.com''' with an FTP client using your CDN account name and a password set either in the SoftLayer [https:\/\/manage.softlayer.com customer portal] or by via the [[SoftLayer_Network_ContentDelivery_Account::setFtpPassword|setFtpPassword]] method \n\nCDN supports the content authentication service. CDN's content authentication service is the technology that allows only authorized user to access your content. It performs a token based authentication before delivering content. An authentication token can be obtained from the SoftLayer customer portal or API and it needs to be appended to the CDN URL. When an end-user requests a file, CDN server will check the validity of the token passed via HTTP GET string with a remote web service provided by SoftLayer. Then the content will be delivered if the value returned from the web service is good otherwise the connection will be rejected. The token authentication web service call is made in real time and it will hold the incoming connection until receiving a value returned from the website. \n\nThere are several scenarios where this authentication capability could be useful. Websites can prevent other rogue websites from linking to their videos. Content owners can prevent users from passing around HTTP links, thus forcing them to login to view contents. See [[SoftLayer_Network_ContentDelivery_Authentication_Token|SoftLayer_Network_ContentDelivery_Authentication_Token]] and [[SoftLayer_Network_ContentDelivery_Authentication_Address|SoftLayer_Network_ContentDelivery_Authentication_Address]] for more details on the content authentication service. \n\n","methods":{"authenticateResourceRequest":{"name":"authenticateResourceRequest","type":"boolean","doc":"Internap servers attempts to validate a token before serving a protected content.

Set a token's expiration time by passing the number of seconds the token should remain active to the [[SoftLayer_Network_ContentDelivery_Authentication_Token::getTimedToken|getTimedToken]] method. For example, if you pass 3600 for the token life to the [[SoftLayer_Network_ContentDelivery_Authentication_Token::getTimedToken|getTimedToken]] method, it will return a token that will expire after an hour of its creation. There is no way to revoke a timed token.  To create a timed token, use the [[SoftLayer_Network_ContentDelivery_Authentication_Token::getTimedToken|getTimedToken]] method and it takes 3 parameters: \n\n<dl> <dt>'''Token Life (required)'''<\/dt> <dd>This value is defined in seconds and outlines the amount of time a token remains valid. To create a token that expires in an hour, pass a Token Life of 3600. The minimum value for Token Life is 60 seconds and the maximum value is 604800 seconds, or one week.<\/dd> \n\n<dt>'''Client IP (optional)'''<\/dt> <dd>If set, the token validation process will match the client IP address. A valid IP address should be an IPv4 format or an IP block. If you want to block access from IP 211.37.0.0\/16, you can enter \"211.37.\" instead. IP blocks can be specified in the manner of \"8bit times n\".<\/dd> \n\n<dt>'''Referring domain (optional)'''<\/dt> <dd>The referrer or referring page is the URL of the previous webpage from which a link was followed. You can further restrict access to your contents by matching referrer information. Set this value only if you are certain about referrer you're expecting. You can only set a domain or an IP address without a path or a file name in it. This can be a part of your domain.

For example, if you have a Windows Media Video file you wish to stream in Flash Video format, transcoding would be the process to make this change. Individual SoftLayer customer can have a single Transcode account and you need to create a Transcode account to use the service. To create a Transcode account, go to the \"Private Network\" -> \"Transcoding\" page in the SoftLayer [https:\/\/manage.softlayer.com customer portal] or invoke [[SoftLayer_Network_Media_Transcode_Account::createTranscodeAccount|createTranscodeAccount]] method. \n\nSoftLayer Transcoding service supports a large number of video and audio codecs. This means you can transcode many different types of movies.  Refer to [http:\/\/knowledgelayer.softlayer.com\/questions\/409\/SoftLayer+Transcoding+FAQ Transcode FAQ] for supported codes and media containers. Transcode server also has hundreds of pre-defined output formats that you can choose from. \n\nA Transcode account object allows you to communicate with the Transcode FTP (transcode.service.softlayer.com server) server and Transcode server. You can retrieve a directory listing, details on a media file, Transcode output presets, and Transcode FTP login credentials. Most importantly, you can create transcode jobs through your Transcode account. \n\nWhen a Transcode account is created, it creates an FTP account on the Transcode FTP. You can upload your media files to the \/in directory and you can download transcoded media files from the \/out directory. You can keep the files 3 days from the creation date. They will be automatically deleted after this point. For more details on the Transcode FTP server, refer to [[SoftLayer_Network_Media_Transcode_Account::getFtpAttributes|getFtpAttributes]] method. ","methods":{"createTranscodeAccount":{"name":"createTranscodeAccount","type":"boolean","doc":"With this method, you can create a transcode account.

SoftLayer_Network_Media_Transcode_Job::createObject returns an object of a newly created Transcode Job. \n\nWith this method, you can create a transcode job. \n\nThe very first step of creating a transcode job is to upload your media files to the \/in directory on your Transcode FTP space. Then, you have to pass a [[SoftLayer_Network_Media_Transcode_Job|Transcode job]] object as a parameter for this method. \n\nThere are 4 required properties of SoftLayer_Network_Media_Transcode_Job object: transcodePresetName, transcodePresetGuid, inputFile, and outputFile. A transcode preset is a configuration that defines a certain media output.  You can retrieve all the supported presets with the [[SoftLayer_Network_Media_Transcode_Account::getPresets|getPresets]] method. You can also use [[SoftLayer_Network_Media_Transcode_Account::getPresetDetail|getPresetDetail]] method to get more information on a preset. Use these two methods to determine appropriate values for \"transcodePresetName\" and \"transcodePresetGuid\" properties. For an \"inputFile\", you must specify a file that exists in the \/in directory of your Transcode FTP space. An \"outputFile\" name will be used by the Transcode server for naming a transcoded file.  An output file name must be in \/out directory. If your outputFile name already exists in the \/out directory, the Transcode server will append a file name with _n (an underscore and the total number of files with the identical name plus 1). \n\nThe \"name\" property is optional and it can help you keep track of transcode jobs easily. \"autoDeleteDuration\" is another optional property that you can specify.  It determines how soon your input file will be deleted. If autoDeleteDuration is set to zero, your input file will be removed immediately after the last transcode job running on it is completed. A value for autoDeleteDuration property is in seconds and the maximum value is 259200 which is 3 days. \n\nAn example SoftLayer_Network_Media_Transcode_Job parameter looks like this: \n\n\n* name: My transcoding\n* transcodePresetName: F4V 896kbps 640x352 16x9 29.97fps\n* transcodePresetGuid: {87E01268-C3E3-4A85-9701-052C9AC42BD4}\n* inputFile: \/in\/my_birthday.wmv\n* outputFile: \/out\/my_birthday_flash\n\n\nNotice that an output file does not have a file extension.  The Transcode server will append a file extension based on an output format. A newly created transcode job will be in \"Pending\" status and it will be added to the Transcoding queue. You will receive a notification email whenever there is a status change on your transcode job.  For example, the Transcode server starts to process your transcode job, you will be notified via an email. \n\nYou can add up to 3 pending jobs at a time. Transcode jobs with any other status such as \"Complete\" or \"Error\" will not be counted toward your pending jobs. \n\nOnce a job is complete, the Transcode server will place the output file into the \/out directory along with a notification email.

The Passmark hardware test is designed to force any latent hardware issues to the surface, so hardware failure is possible. \n\nIn the event of a hardware failure during this test our datacenter engineers will be notified of the problem automatically. They will then replace any failed components to bring your server back online, and will be contacting you to ensure that impact on your server is minimal.

Invoices exist in three states: \n*'''OPEN''': Invoices which have not been paid yet. Invoices are created in the OPEN state.\n*'''CLOSED''': Invoices that SoftLayer has received payment for.\n*'''CLOSED_FAILED''': Invoices which were closed but were not paid for. Customers who are terminated for non-payment typically have invoices in this state.\n\n\nOnce an invoice is paid it moves from OPEN to CLOSED state. Invoices are created under varying types, which are defined in the type property of the [[SoftLayer_Invoice (type)|SoftLayer_Invoice data type]]. Invoices are created under one of the following type categories: \n*'''NEW''': An invoice for new service. A SoftLayer customer's first invoice is of the NEW type.\n*'''RECURRING''': Invoices that are generated on a SoftLayer customer's anniversary billing date for monthly services.\n*'''ONE-TIME-CHARGE''': Invoices that are generated when one-time charges are applied to an account for fees incurred from products or services procured outside of the standard purchasing processes.\n*'''CREDIT''': Invoices that are generated whenever SoftLayer applies a credit against an account's balance.\n*'''REFUND''': Account credits that are applied against a customer's account balance along with the receivables on their account. REFUND type invoices are generated whenever a customer receives a service credit on their account balance and has their invoice items changed due to the credit.\n*'''MANUAL_PAYMENT_CREDIT''': Invoice credits that are generated whenever a customer makes an manual payment.\n\n\nInvoices are created with contact information duplicated from the [[SoftLayer_Account (type)|SoftLayer_Account data type]]. We do this in order to maintain a history of an account's contact information as invoices are generated. Likewise each invoice record keeps track of an account's balance as the invoice is opened and closed. \n\nQuery the [[SoftLayer_Account]] service to get a list of invoices for your account.

If you're a PayPal customer, a URL will be returned from the call to [[SoftLayer_Product_Order\/placeOrder|placeOrder]] which is to be used to finish the authorization process. This authorization tells PayPal that you indeed want to place an order with SoftLayer. From PayPal's web site, you will be redirected back to SoftLayer for your order receipt.<br\/><br\/> \n\n\nWhen an order is placed, your order will be in a \"pending approval\" state. When all internal checks pass, your order will be automatically approved. For orders that may need extra attention, a Sales representative will review the order and contact you if necessary. Once the order is approved, your server or service will be provisioned and available to you shortly thereafter. Depending on the type of server or service ordered, provisioning times will vary.<br\/><br\/> \n\n\n<h2>Order Containers<\/h2> \n\n\nWhen placing API orders, it's important to order your server and services on the appropriate [[SoftLayer_Container_Product_Order (type)|order container]]. Failing to provide the correct container may delay your server or service from being provisioned in a timely manner. Some common order containers are included below.<br\/><br\/> \n\n\n<strong>Note:<\/strong> <code>SoftLayer_Container_Product_Order_<\/code> has been removed from the containers in the table below for

A ticket is an entity that describes a problem or request and tracks a conversation between you, your account users, and SoftLayer employees relating to your problem or request. Tickets can be assigned to one of your account users, and SoftLayer can assign a ticket to a particular department (also called a ticket group) or employee. The SoftLayer_Ticket service controls your interaction with SoftLayer's ticketing system. \n\nEvery ticket object has at least one ticket update. Ticket updates may be created by either a user or SoftLayer employee. These ticket updates record the conversation between SoftLayer and you about the issue at hand. You may only add new updates to a ticket. Once an update is created you may not edit or delete it. \n\nTickets exist in one of three states: open, assigned, and closed. Open tickets are considered a current issue, but are not yet assigned to a specific SoftLayer employee. Assigned issues are open issues that are assigned to a SoftLayer employee. You can safely assume that your ticket is being handled if it is in the Assigned state. Closed tickets are considered resolved issues and allow no further updates. Please contact SoftLayer if you need to re-open a ticket, as you may only create ticket updates on open or assigned tickets. \n\nIt is possible to attach files and associate hardware with a ticket. Associating your ticket with more than one pieces of hardware helps SoftLayer's support team localize issues to certain servers. Attachments are a good way to illustrate a point, such as adding a screen shot of a problem or attaching a driver or configuration file that you'd like investigated. \n\nTypically the only tickets an account user may create are technical support tickets. Technical support tickets are divided into two categories: standard tickets and administrative tickets. A standard support ticket describes an issue with your SoftLayer server or services. Standard support tickets' titles must be selected from a pre-determined list of ticket subjects, defined in the [[SoftLayer_Ticket_Subject]] service. If you need a little help from SoftLayer's support staff to manage your server then open an administrative support ticket. Administrative tickets add a one-time $3USD charge to your account, and you may specify your ticket's title as needed.
